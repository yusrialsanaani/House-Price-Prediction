# House Price Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the houses sale. This project leverages the supervised/ unsupervised ML techniques, utilizes different exploratory data analysis and processing techniques, uses different features engineer methods, and then select the appropriate machine learning models. 

The general approach used for this project follows the standard machine learning life cycle that includes project planning phase, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, features engineering, modeling, and predictions as shown in Figure 1. Each step in the diagram shown in Figure 1 will be described in the next subsections.
The next step is to collect and consolidate the data, wrangle it, and conduct exploratory data analysis. Once the data is ready to go, the next steps are to select ML models, split the dataset, train the selected models with training data, fine-tune the models, and evaluate the models using the testing data based on the pre-determined success metrics. The last step is to select the best model and productionize it.
